3.  ***Coding text files with nodes***
    - Select the **Files** icon in the Navigation pane and double click the "SouthChinaMorningPost_2019-07-18.pdf" text file listed in the File List pane to open it in the Detail pane. Read through the document and keep an eye out for key issues and themes brought up by each of the speakers in the 9 countries covered. In the following steps we will code and organize themes identified in the document by creating a series of nodes.
    - **Coding at a new node:** The speaker from Australia mentions increasing summer temperatures. To create a node representing this theme, highlight the related sentence, ctrl-click the highlighted text and select **Code Selection** and then **At New Code**. Title your new Node "increasing temperature"

    <img src="images\mac instructions\new-node-coding.gif" alt="coding at new node" style="width:480px;">
    <img src="images\mac instructions\new-node-coding.png" alt="menu for coding at new node" style="width:480px;">
    
    - **Coding at an existing node:** The speaker from Vietnam also talks about increasing temperatures. Ctrl-click the highlighted text, select **Code Selection** and then **To Existing Codes and Cases** and select "increasing temperature"
    
    <img src="images\mac instructions\old-node-coding.gif" alt="coding at existing node" style="width:480px;">
    
    - You can code the same pieces of text as multiple themes. In this same text we coded as "increasing temperature" from the Australian speaker, they also mention coral bleaching. Create a new node for this topic and recode this sentence
    
    <img src="images\mac instructions\multi-themes.gif" alt="coding multiple themes" style="width:480px;">
    
    - **Highlighting Codes:** To see what portions of text in your document have been coded, at the top of the detail pane, click the **Highlight** icon and select **All Coding**. If you want to only see specific codes highlighted in the text, select **Coding for Selected Items** and pick from the list displayed, then click **Okay**
    
    <img src="images\mac instructions\highlighting-code.gif" alt="highlighting code" style="width:480px;">
    
    - **Coding Density** To get a visual sense of the coding density of your nodes and spot patterns in the distribution of topics, turn on coding stripes. Make sure the "SouthChinaMorningPost_2019-07-18.pdf" file is visible in the detail pane. At the top of the detail pane, select the **Coding Stripes** icon and, in the drop-down menu, select **All**
    
    <img src="images\mac instructions\coding-density.gif" alt="coding density" style="width:480px;">
    
    - **Key Themes:** Continue coding the rest of this document by creating nodes and applying them to the sentences they are contained in. Identify themes related to:
        - i.   Impacts
        - ii.  Barriers
        - iii. Solutions
    - Aim to identify at least 3 to 5 themes in each response. If you need to remove codes, highlight the piece of text, right-click and select **Uncode Selection**
    
    <img src="images\mac instructions\uncode-selection.gif" alt="uncode" style="width:480px;">
    
    - **Creating Node Hierarchies:** As you create more and more nodes, you may start to see a hierarchy of themes emerge. You can group nodes into parent or child categories. Using the "Impact", "Barriers", and "Solutions" themes, organize your nodes into a hierarchy. To do so, first create a new node titled "Barriers". Double click the **Coding** icon in the navigation pane to display it in the file list pane. Click the **Code** icon in the top ribbon under the **Create** tab. Click **New Code**. In the dialogue box that appears, name a new node "Barriers"
    - With your nodes list displayed in the file list pane, you can drag and drop the child nodes representing barriers onto the parent node to create a hierarchy. Repeat for nodes representing Impacts and Solutions
    - It can be helpful to group references from all child nodes together under a parent theme. To copy the coding from the child nodes to the parent node, in the list view ctrl-click the new Barriers node and select **Aggregate Coding From Children**
    
    <img src="images\mac instructions\code-hierarchy.gif" alt="coding hierarchy" style="width:480px;">
    
    - **Removing Child Nodes:** To remove a child node from a hierarchy, ctrl-click the node and select **Move to Top Level**
    - **Viewing Node References** To view all the pieces of text coded at a given node, from the file list pane double click the desired node. This will open up a window in the detail pane with all the references.

4.  ***Word frequency queries***
    - Running a word frequency query can help you establish nodes prior to coding and give you a sense of the content of your file. Click the **Explore** tab in the Top Ribbon, and then click the **Word Frequency** icon
    - The **Word Frequency Criteria** menu opens in a new window. Click the **Search in Selected Items** button to choose which file(s) to search. In the dialogue box that appears, select the "WashingtonPost_2020-02-03.pdf" file, then click **Okay**
    - In the **Word Frequency Criteria** menu, you can adjust the parameters of your search, including the number of results to display, the minimum word character length for inclusion in the search, and how to group similar words together in the search. Click **Run Query** to execute the word frequency calculation. How do the results compare with your nodes?
    
    <img src="images\word-frequency.png" alt="word frequency query" style="width:600px;">
    
    - Try modifying these parameters and see how your results change. Make sure to click **Run Query** each time to re-execute the query
    - Ctrl-click terms you want to exclude from your results and select **Add to Stop Words List**. To view words in the stop word list choose **File** then **Project Properties**, click **General** and then click the **Stop Words** button
    - To save the query, click the **Save Criteria** button. The results will be saved in the **Queries** folder in the navigation pane.

5.  ***Text search queries***
    - Text search queries allow you to search for particular words or phrases within and across the documents you have imported into NVivo. Click the **Explore** tab in the Top Ribbon, and then click the **Text Search** icon
    - The **Text Search Criteria** menu opens in a new window. Click the **Search in Selected Items** button to choose which file(s) to search. In the dialogue box that appears, select the "WashingtonPost_2020-02-03.pdf" text file, then click **Select**
    - Open the list of nodes in the file list view pane. Let's see whether any of the themes we identified in the first debate are also discussed in the second debate
    - Enter the term "drought" into the text search box and click **Run Query**. 1 reference should be found
    - Play around with some of your other nodes and search options (stemmed words). Some samples to try including: disaster, displace, lobby, activism, coral etc.
    
    <img src="images\arduino-icon.png" alt="arduino icon" style="width:480px;">
    
    - Double click the copy of the file listed below the **Text Search Criteria**. The words in the search string are now highlighted within the context of the document
    - To code the highlighted text, in the **Text Search Query** click **Save Results**. In the dialogue box that appears, select **Create Results as New Node**. Next to **Location** click the arrow, then select **Nodes**

6.  ***Matrix coding queries***
    - Matrix coding queries enable you to see coding intersections between two lists of items. For example, let's explore how our Impact codes intersect with countries
    - First, create nodes for each country represented in the sources and apply each of them to the related text
    - Under the **Explore** tab, click **Matrix Coding Query**. Search in **Files & Externals**. Select, drag, and drop all of the Country child Nodes into the Rows and drag and drop all of the Impact child themes nodes into the Columns text boxes. Then select **Run Query**
    - The resulting matrix shows counts of which impacts were raised by speakers from different countries
    - To save the query, click the **Save Results** button. The results will be saved in the **Queries** folder in the navigation pane.

    <img src="images\mac instructions\matrix-query.gif" alt="matrix query" style="width:480px;">

7.  ***Creating visualizations***
    - **Visualizing Query Results:** NVivo automatically creates visualizations for Queries. Re-open your saved Word Frequency Query. On the right-side of the results summary, a tab indicating **Word Cloud** is available

    <img src="images\mac instructions\visualize-query.gif" alt="creating visualizations" style="width:480px;">

8.  ***Exporting materials***
    - **Project Export:** In the rop ribbon, under **Share** click the **Export Project** icon. In the dialogue box that appears, you can browse to select where to save the file
    - **Individual Item Export:** You can also export the codebook and other content generated in NVivo as individual files. In the top ribbon, under **Share** click the **Export** icon and select **Export Codebook**. In the dialogue box that appears, select codes and browse to select where to save the file. You can choose to save the file as either in MS Word format (\*.docx) or MS Excel (\*.xlsx)
