# ACTIVITY: Youth Climate March News Analysis

1. Creating a project and navigating the workspace
    - Open NVivo and select **Blank Project**
    - In the **New Project** dialogue box that opens, enter a title for your project "2019 Youth Climate March News Analysis"
    - Next to the **File** name field, select where to save your project file with **Browse**
    - Check the box next to **Write user actions to project event log** (this will keep track of your methodology and retrace your steps later on). Click **Okay** when finished
    **There are 4 key areas of the NVivo workspace:**
        - Top Ribbon - all of the commands and options in NVivo are found here
        - Navigation Pane - where you view and organize your files
        - File list pane - displays contents of folders selected in the navigation pane
        - Detail pane - displays contents of files and project items
2. Importing your files
    - Download the two workshop activity files from [this directory](https://bit.ly/DSC_NVIVO_Activity_1_Files){:target="_blank"}
    - Select the **Import** tab on the top ribbon and then select **Files**
    - Navigate to the two files you saved to your computer. Select the two PDFs and click **Open**
    - On the **Import Files** dialogue box that appears, select **Import**
    - In the file list pane you'll see the files listed. Icons indicate the file type: ***image*** text file; ***image*** pdf file; ***image*** audio file

    - Double click the "SouthChinaMorningPost_2019-07-18.pdf" file to display it in the detail pane. Read through the document and keep an eye out for key issues and themes brought up by each of the speakers in the 9 countries covered. In the following steps we will code and organize themes identified in the document by creating a series of nodes
    - **Coding at a new node:** The speaker from Australia mentions increasing summer temperatures. To create a node representing this theme, highlight the related sentence, right-click the highlightedtext and select **Code**. In the **Select Code Items** dialogue box that appears, select **Nodes** and click **New Node**. Title your new node "increasing temperature"
    - **Coding at an existing node:** The speaker from Vietnam also talks about increasing temperatures. Right-click the highlighted text, select **Code to Recent Nodes** and select **increasing temperature**
    - You can code the same pieces of text as multiple themes. In this same text that we coded as "increasing temperature" from the Australian speaker, they also mention coral bleaching. Create a new node for this topic and recode this sentence
    - **Quick Coding Bar:** The coding bar at the bottom of the workspace can be a quick way to code text. Select the text in your file you wish to code. On the quick coding bar, type the name of a new or existing node (as you start typing, the names of nodes will start to show up), and then click enter on your keyboard
    - **Highlighting Codes:** To see what portions of text in your document have been coded, in the top ribbon under the **Document** tab click the **Highlight** icon and select **All Coding**. If you want to only see specific codes highlighted in the tet, select **Coding for Selected Items** and pick from the list displayed, then click **Okay**
    - **Coding Density:** To get a visual sense of the coding density of your nodes and spot patterns in the distribution of topics, turn on coding stripes. Make sure the "SouthChinaMorningPost_2019-07-18.pdf" file is visible in the detail pane. In the top ribbon, select the **Document** tab, click the **Coding Stripes** icon and, in the drop-down menu, select **All Coding**
    - **Key Themes:** Continue coding the rest of this document by creating nodes and applying them to the sentences they are contained in. Identify themes related to:
        - i.   Impacts
        - ii.  Barriers
        - iii. Solutions
    - Aim to identify at least 3 to 5 themes in each response. If you need to remove codes, highlight the piece og text, right-click and select **Uncode**
    - **Create Node Hierarchies:** As you create more and more nodes, you may start to see a hierarchy of themes emerge. You can group nodes into parent or child categories. Using the "Impact", "Bariers", and "Solutions" themes, organize your nodes into a hierarchy. To do so, first create a new node titled "Barriers". Double click the **Nodes** icon in the navigation pane to display it in the file list pane. Click the **Node** icon in the top ribbon under the **Create** tab. In the **New Node** dialogue box that appears, name a new node "Barriers"
    - With your nodes list displayed in the file list pane, you can drag and drop the child nodesrepresenting barriers onto the parent node to create a hierarchy. Repeat for nodes representing Impacts and Solutions
    - It can be helpgul to group references from all child nodes together under a parent theme. To copy the coding from the child nodes to the parent node, in the list view right click the parent node and select **Aggregate Coding from Children**
    - **Removing Child Nodes:** To remove a child node from a hierarchy, drag the child node to the **Nodes** icon in the navigation pane
    - **Viewing node references:** To view all the pieves of text coded at a given node, from the **Nodes** list double click the desired node. This will open up a window in the detail pane with all the references.
    - Time permitting, repeat the above exercise for the "WashingtonPost_2020-02-03.pdf" file continuing to use and build upon your themes hierarchy
